# BlockChain Using JavaScript:

-> Constructed a BlockChain Data Structure using JavaScript
-> Designed an API to interact with the Blockchain Data Structure to execute tasks like Registering and Broadcastin a Node, Mine a block....etc
-> Converted the API into a Decentralized Blockchain Network
-> Synchronized the Data across the entire network, running on multiple different Nodes
-> Constructed a Consensus Algorithm to make sure that the data on all the nodes are Synchronized and Legitimate
-> Added a Block Explorer UI to easily search for a Block or Transaction or Data of a  node at a speccific address

Note: The Consensus algorithm is based on or implements the *Longest Chain Rule*, which is implemented/used in many of the blockchain networks, in real life.
